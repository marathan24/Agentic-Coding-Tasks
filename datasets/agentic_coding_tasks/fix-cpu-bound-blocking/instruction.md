The async application has a performance bottleneck where the `/calculate` endpoint performs intensive CPU-bound calculations that completely block the event loop. This blocking behavior prevents other concurrent operations from executing, most notably causing the `/heartbeat` endpoint to freeze instead of updating every second as expected. Your task is to refactor the code in `/app/cpu_task.py` to handle these heavy computations without starving other coroutines of execution time. The solution should leverage proper async patterns to ensure that CPU-intensive work doesn't monopolize the event loop. After your changes, both the calculations and the heartbeat must work concurrently, with the heartbeat continuing to update at regular one-second intervals even while intensive calculations are running.
