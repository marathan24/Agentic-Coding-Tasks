I need to see the current implementation of /app/catalog_service.py (and        
possibly the DataStore interface it uses) to propose concrete changes that keep 
behavior identical while improving performance.                                 

Please paste the contents of:                                                   

 • app/catalog_service.py                                                       
 • Any related datastore file(s), e.g. something like app/datastore.py or       
   whatever module defines the DataStore used by catalog_service.py.            

Once I have those, I’ll:                                                        

 1 Analyze where the slow calls and repeated work are.                          
 2 Propose a faster in-memory/indexed approach that minimizes DataStore calls   
   while preserving behavior.                                                   
 3 Return a full updated version of app/catalog_service.py (and any other files 
   that must change) in the exact file-listing format you specified.
