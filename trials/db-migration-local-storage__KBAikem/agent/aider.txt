I need to see the current implementation of /app/service.py (and possibly any   
related files like the CSV loader, models, or startup code) to refactor it      
correctly while preserving behavior and the tracking endpoint.                  

Please paste the current contents of:                                           

 • app/service.py                                                               

If the CSV loading or DB setup lives elsewhere (for example app/db.py,          
app/main.py, or similar), please also share those files so I can ensure the     
refactor keeps the same API contract and performance characteristics.
